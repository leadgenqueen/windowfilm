    question: "Will window film make my windows too dark?",
    answer: "Not at all! Modern window films can block 99% of UV rays and significant heat while maintaining excellent visibility. We offer films ranging from virtually clear to various tint levels. During our free consultation, we'll show you samples directly on your windows so you can see exactly how each option will look."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I remove the film later if I change my mind?",
    answer: "Yes, professional window film can be removed without damaging your windows. However, with our lifetime residential warranty and the proven benefits our clients experience, removal requests are extremely rare. Most clients are so pleased with the results that they often add film to additional windows."
  },
  {
    question: "Does window film void my window warranty?",
    answer: "Our films are designed to work safely with modern windows and typically don't void warranties when professionally installed. We'll review your specific window manufacturer's guidelines during consultation and ensure compliance. Many window manufacturers actually approve quality films like the ones we install."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does installation take?",
    answer: "Most residential installations are completed in 4-8 hours, depending on the number and size of windows. Commercial projects vary by scope. We work efficiently to minimize disruption to your daily routine, and you can use your windows normally immediately after installation."
  },
  {
    question: "Will window film work on my double-pane or hurricane windows?",
    answer: "Absolutely! We specialize in all window types common to the Gulf Coast, including double-pane, triple-pane, hurricane-rated, and impact-resistant windows. Different window types may require specific films for optimal performance, which we'll determine during your free assessment."
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I expect to save on my energy bills?",
    answer: "Most clients see 20-30% reduction in cooling costs, with some experiencing even greater savings. The exact amount depends on your current windows, home size, and cooling system efficiency. We'll provide a customized energy savings estimate during your free consultation based on your specific situation."
